# What DDS and Peer-to-Peer Communication Are



## What Is DDS?

DDS stands for **Data Distribution Service**. It's what ROS 2 uses so that nodes (programs) can talk to each other.

What DDS does:
- Helps nodes **find each other automatically**.
- Makes sure that only the right data goes to the right place.
- Lets us **set rules** for how data should be sent (for example: should it be reliable? should it keep old messages?).

Basically, DDS is like a smart messaging system that figures out who wants what and sends it over.

## What Is the OSI Model?

Before learning more about DDS, I came across something called the **OSI model**. It’s a way to understand how computers talk to each other in layers.

Here are the 7 layers (from bottom to top):

1. Physical – cables and signals  
2. Data Link – things like Ethernet  
3. Network – IP addresses (used to find computers)  
4. Transport – how the data is sent (TCP or UDP)  
5. Session – keeping the connection alive  
6. Presentation – how the data is formatted or encrypted  
7. Application – where the actual apps run (like your browser or a ROS 2 node)

## Where Does DDS Fit In?

DDS mainly works in the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** because it handles the actual content that programs send and receive.

But DDS also connects with the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**, because it often uses **UDP**, a fast (but less reliable) way to send messages. DDS adds smart features on top of UDP to make it more reliable when needed.

So DDS kind of lives between the top and middle of the OSI model — handling both what the message is and how it gets there.

## What Is Peer-to-Peer Communication?

**Peer-to-peer (P2P)** means every node is equal. No one is in charge. Everyone can send and receive data directly.

In a peer-to-peer system:
- There’s no central server.
- Nodes find and connect with each other.
- If one node crashes, the others can keep working.

It’s kind of like group chat vs. a teacher talking to a whole class. Everyone can speak and listen.

## How DDS Uses Peer-to-Peer

DDS works in a peer-to-peer way.

- Each node (robot or program) joins a communication group called a "domain."
- It says what it wants to send (topics it publishes) and what it wants to receive (topics it subscribes to).
- DDS automatically finds other nodes with matching topics.
- Then, those nodes talk to each other **directly**.

This means we don’t need something like the ROS 1 master anymore. DDS does all the matching and message sending **without a central controller**.

### Peer-to-Peer vs Client-to-Peer

In a **peer-to-peer** network, all nodes communicate directly with each other without needing a central/master node. In a **client-to-peer** (or client-server) network, nodes rely on a central node (like a master node) to register and find other nodes before they can communicate.

### Why ROS 2 Doesn’t Need a Master Node

ROS 2 uses DDS, which allows nodes to automatically discover each other on the network without a central master. This removes the single point of failure that the master node creates in ROS 1. Because of this, ROS 2 is more scalable, flexible, and robust nodes can join or leave the network anytime without disrupting communication.
